				<p>Cacti are cool and fun from afar, sure. But in Phoenix the cacti aren't just a pretty picture anymore, they're on your streets, in your yards, and if you're not careful, in your skin. We have jumping cacti that live up to their name and really attack you. That cactus in the picture looks kinda fluffy and soft right? It's name "Teddy Bear" cholla would lead you to believe it's friendly and pet-able. But that couldn't be more wrong. These little assholes have barbs that stick to anything and everything and are extremely difficult and painful to remove. Those barbs live on the many, many lobes that fall off and stick to you, your children, your pets, and your soul if you so much as look at it sideways.</p>

				<p>Despite seeming like The Absolute Worst Plant to Plant, these satan cacti are everywhere. They're intentionally planted as landscaping and scattered throughout the large swaths of desert wash that are sprinkled throughout the city. When we say "stay on the paths" we say it in part so you don't get lost and die of heat stroke or dehydration but also so you don't run into one of these bastard cacti.</p>
