## Kyler Wong - Phoenix, AZ
### Color Scheme
- Consistent color scheme
- Colors work well with each other and with images used
- Text color makes text stand out on background for readability

### Layout and Box Model
- Consistent and non-distracting layout for article pages
- Content is given plenty of room
- Page layout does not adjust to accommodate viewports of different sizes
- Homepage is the only page to have the navigation bar on the left, making it difficult to click through pages quickly

### Visual Embellishments
- Opacity makes text stand out without clashing with the background
- Tiles on bottom of homepage are simple until the user hovers over it, limiting distraction

### Standout Features
- Fonts are fun and match tone of website
- Tiles on bottom of homepage provides embellishment and extra information

### Things to Change
1. Center content boxes
2. The footer should be fixed to the bottom
3. Move navigation bar on homepage to the right
4. Make pages more mobile-friendly

## Matthew Leone - Ridgewood, NJ
### Color Scheme
- The simple, muted color scheme does not distract from content
- Text is readable with the colors used for text and background
- The black text in the footer conflicts with the brown text used for the rest of the sight.  The difference is hard to notice at first, but jarring on second glance

### Layout and Box Model
- Text is given sufficient space
- The images and headers are squished to the left, but the right is left empty, misuse of space
- Navigation bar is not visible when first viewing a page

### Visual Embellishments
- Font is neither boring nor distracting
- The changing opacity on the two images makes it clear they are links, but there is nothing indicating that both of the images link to the homepage

### Standout Features
- Information on the site is readable with large text
- Headers stand out from the paragraphs without distracting

### Things to Change
1. Make navigation bar visible when page first loads, not after scrolling
2. Make better use of space at the top of the pages
3. Change footer text color to match the rest of the site

## Professor Kostin - New York City
### Color Scheme
- Simple non-distracting color scheme
- The gold fits in well with the seal displayed on each page
- Text is not as easy to read in the darker color cells of the homepage table

### Layout and Box Model
- Good use of space, majority of content is visible without scrolling
- Layout works well for more than one viewport size

### Visual Embellishments
- Images are used sparingly enough to be catch the user's eye without distracting from content or being overwhelming
- The seal looks nice at the top of the page, but its fixed position can make text difficult to read, especially when the user is scrolling

### Standout Features
- Use of color and images in the subheadings make them visually striking
- Layout is a good use of space and is consistent to make it easier for users to navigate

### Things to Change
1. Fix seal's position to increase readability
2. Adjust homepage table colors to increase readability
