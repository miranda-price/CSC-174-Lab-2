                    <p>If you count all the surrounding districts, more than 4.1 million people crowd into this sprawling, suburbanite wasteland, yet no one really likes it here. This metropolis is squatted in subtropical desert. It shouldn't even exist. It's spitting in God's face. (VICE news)</p>

                            <p>People say we're lucky because it's a "dry heat" and it doesn't snow here. I say it's a season-less oven that occasionally turns off in the winter. Summer lasts at least 8 months and we don't have those nifty cool summer nights other places do. <a href="weather.php">Read More...</a></p>

                            <p>Since it's ya know... a <em>desert</em>, it doesn't really rain here. In fact, in 2021, it has rained less than an inch in many parts of Phoenix. Phoenix is considered to be in an "Extreme Drought", but at least we're not in an "Exceptional Drought" I guess? <a href="water.php">Read More...</a></p>

But in Phoenix the cacti aren't just a pretty picture anymore, they're on your streets, in your yards, and if you're not careful, in your skin. We have jumping cacti that live up to their name and really attack you. <a href="cactus.php">Read More...</a></p>
